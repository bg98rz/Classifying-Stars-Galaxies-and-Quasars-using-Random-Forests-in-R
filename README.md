# Classifying-Stars-Galaxies-and-Quasars-using-Random-Forests-in-R

# Data: SDSS DR14 Data Release, Collected July 2016, 10,000 observations of individual astronomical artefacts.

	This project explores the automated classification of 3 separate astronomical artefacts, namely galaxy, stars and Quasi-Stellar Objects (Quasar), 
  utilising data from the SDSS DR14 data release. Several random forest models were trained using 75% of the dataset and evaluated using the remaining 25%, 
  ultimately achieving a maximum classification accuracy of roughly 99.3% during testing.
